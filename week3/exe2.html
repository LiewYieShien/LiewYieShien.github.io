    <p>
        Hi, my name is Liew Yie Shien, or you can call me Tiffany as well.
        I am from Kuala Lumpur and living in Kepong.
        I really enjoy photography and making videos for memories.
        Besides, I am an outgoing and extroverted person.
        For example, I like to go somewhere else that fulled with nature sceneries and exploring
        different kind of activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than that, I get way too excited after seeing animals, especially dogs and cats.
        My favorite song from Eric Chou is called "Best Friend".
        Furthermore, my favourite country is Switzerland, which located in Europe.
        I wish that one day in the future I am able to bring my family members travel around the world by spending my
        own money.
        Have a nice day!
    </p>
